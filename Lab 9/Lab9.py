# this exercise, you will write a program that makes use of two dictionaries. The program
# should read the data in rawdata.txt into a dictionary whose keys are country names and whose
# values are per capita incomes. Also create another dictionary whose keys are letters A‐ Z and
# whose values are sets of country names. Convert the country names to all uppercase for both
# dictionaries.
# Your program should prompt the user to enter an initial or a country names and then print the
# corresponding values.
# * If the user enters a string with only one letter (like A), the program should print all the
# countries that begin with that letter,
# * If the user enters a string that contains more than one letter, print the corresponding
# value for that country if it exists or print “Does not exist” if invalid.
# * Stop when the user enters quit.
